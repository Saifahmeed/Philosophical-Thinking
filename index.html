      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I will explore three fundamental questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What is the difference between thinking and scientific measurement?
        </li>
        <li>
          How should thinking take into consideration the fourfold of human
          being (Earth, Sky, Divinities, and Mortals)?
        </li>
        <li>
          In what ways is thinking, grounded in the fourfold of our being,
          manifested in aspects of life such as professional, personal,
          spiritual, or artistic experiences?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By analyzing clips from thought-provoking videos and movies, I aim to
        unravel how Heidegger’s ideas challenge the modern reliance on
        calculative reasoning, instead urging us to embrace a deeper, more
        meaningful mode of thinking. Drawing connections between Heidegger’s
        philosophy, cultural expressions like Miyazaki’s films, and my own
        experiences, I will show how the interplay of the fourfold of our being
        can ground us in a more holistic understanding of life.

            This clip delves into Heidegger’s critique of the instrumental view
            of technology. As described in the video, “this is what Heidegger
            calls the anthropological or instrumental view of technology, and
            it’s trivially true,” this perspective reduces technology to being
            just a tool for achieving goals. While not incorrect, Heidegger
            believes this viewpoint is shallow because it overlooks the essence
            of technology—how it profoundly shapes human existence and our
            connection to the world.
            <br />
            The video explains that this instrumental perspective focuses solely
            on what technology can do, ignoring its broader implications.
            Heidegger challenges us to go beyond evaluating technology’s
            functionality and instead reflect on how it transforms the way we
            see and engage with reality. By doing so, we uncover the deeper
            impact of technology, urging us to think critically not only about
            its usefulness but also its influence on defining the human
            experience.

            In this clip, the video delves into Heidegger’s concept of the
            essence of technology as a mode of revealing. For Heidegger,
            technology is not just about tools but a way of uncovering or
            bringing forth truth.
            <br />
            The example of the lake illustrates how different contexts reveal
            the same object differently. A medieval peasant might see the lake
            as a place of rest, while a modern industrialist might see it as a
            potential site for a hydraulic plant. This shift in perception
            demonstrates that revealing is not objective but deeply shaped by
            one's worldview and purpose and how technology can change our
            preception.
            <br />
            Heidegger introduces "enframing" as the technological mode of
            revealing. Enframing presents everything as standing
            reserve—resources ready for use. Under this mode, the value of
            things is determined by their utility. This perspective influences
            not just how we see the world but how we act, prioritize, and define
            meaning, emphasizing efficiency and control over intrinsic value.
            The clip challenges us to consider how this technological framing
            shapes modern life and our sense of what truly matters.

          <p class="explanation">
            In this clip, the video highlights Heidegger’s critique of
            "enframing," a concept central to his understanding of technology's
            essence. The quote, “nature becomes a gigantic gasoline station, an
            energy source for modern technology and industry,” encapsulates his
            concern that under enframing, the world is reduced to a mere
            resource—standing reserve—ready for exploitation and calculation.
            <br />
            Heidegger doesn’t reject technology or science outright, nor does he
            advocate for primitivism. Instead, his critique focuses on how
            enframing dominates modern life, shaping not only how we see the
            world but also how we think and act. It creates the illusion that
            its way of revealing the world—through efficiency, utility, and
            control—is the only valid perspective. This mindset marginalizes
            other ways of experiencing the world, such as seeing it poetically
            or appreciating its inherent beauty.
            <br />
            The video’s connection to Miyazaki’s films is a brilliant way to
            illustrate Heidegger’s point. Miyazaki’s movies often reveal the
            world as something sacred, full of wonder and intrinsic value,
            rather than as a resource to be exploited. Heidegger would likely
            see this as an alternative mode of revealing, one that reminds us of
            what enframing tends to obscure: the richness and diversity of ways
            to experience and relate to the world. This perspective isn’t about
            abandoning technology but about rethinking how we engage with it and
            ensuring it doesn’t overshadow other, deeper dimensions of
            existence.

          <p class="explanation">
            In this clip, the video dives into Heidegger’s idea of challenging
            forth—how modern technology forces nature into being something it’s
            not. As the quote says, “technology coerces nature...it forces it to
            be transformed into mere resources,” this means technology doesn’t
            just use nature—it dominates and exploits it, stripping away its
            essence and treating it as nothing more than raw material.
            <br />
            Heidegger contrasts this with bringing forth, an approach rooted in
            respect and care. Imagine an artisan carving a violin from wood.
            They don’t fight against the wood’s nature; instead, they work with
            it, bringing out its natural beauty—its texture, imperfections, and
            unique qualities. There’s a partnership between the artisan and the
            material, where each shapes the other in a way that respects what
            the material inherently is.
            <br />
            Modern technology, on the other hand, doesn’t care about this
            harmony. It demands, extracts, and exploits, often to the point of
            destruction—like cutting down forests faster than they can regrow or
            overfeeding animals until they can’t move. Heidegger sees this as a
            dangerous mindset, where nature is treated as nothing but a resource
            to be used up.
            <br />
            This is why Heidegger and the video connect so strongly to the
            craftsmanship often shown in Miyazaki’s films. Miyazaki’s stories
            celebrate the beauty of working with your hands and respecting the
            world around you. They remind us of a time when people worked with
            nature rather than against it, showing us how much more meaningful
            and fulfilling that relationship can be. For Heidegger, this isn’t
            about rejecting technology but about learning to engage with the
            world in a way that honors its essence rather than ignoring it.

            In this clip, the video draws a thoughtful parallel between
            Miyazaki’s careful use of technology in filmmaking and Heidegger’s
            philosophy. The quote, “he always insists on drawing by hand,”
            reflects Miyazaki’s commitment to preserving the human touch in his
            work. He is wary of how technology, when overused, can shift the
            creative process towards efficiency, often at the cost of
            authenticity and emotional expression.
            <br />
            This echoes Heidegger’s own refusal to use a typewriter. Heidegger
            believed that a typewriter homogenizes writing—it removes the
            personal mark of the writer’s hand, stripping away the individuality
            and human connection that handwritten work carries. For both
            Miyazaki and Heidegger, the concern isn’t technology itself but how
            it can change the way we experience the world, often prioritizing
            speed over depth and uniqueness.
            <br />
            Miyazaki’s insistence on drawing by hand is a resistance to this
            trend. It’s a reminder that some forms of creation demand the
            personal touch—the imperfections, the quirks, and the time it takes
            to make something truly meaningful. In a world increasingly driven
            by technological optimization, both Heidegger and Miyazaki remind us
            of the value in slowing down, staying connected to the process, and
            preserving what makes our work—and ourselves—unique.

            In this clip, the video discusses Heidegger’s idea of how modern
            technology transforms the way we see and interact with the earth.
            The quote, “the earth now reveals itself as a coal mining district,
            the soil is a mineral deposit,” shows how technology reduces the
            natural world to a collection of resources to be exploited. What was
            once land that peasants carefully tended, respecting its natural
            processes, has now become something to challenge and extract from.
            <br />
            Heidegger contrasts this with the older practice of bringing forth,
            where the work of farming involved cooperating with nature—planting
            seeds and trusting in the forces of growth. This approach respected
            the land’s rhythms and essence, treating it as something to care
            for, not dominate. Today, agriculture itself has become part of what
            Heidegger calls challenging forth, where nature is forced into
            submission, becoming a mechanized food industry driven by efficiency
            and output. Even the air and earth are seen as resources to be
            mined, processed, or manipulated.
            <br />
            The video’s connection to Princess Mononoke beautifully illustrates
            this tension. Miyazaki’s film portrays the clash between traditional
            ways of living and the rise of industrialization, where nature is
            stripped of its intrinsic value and turned into something to be
            extracted and used. As the official website explains, the movie
            reflects the early stages of the seemingly endless conflict between
            the natural world and modern industrial civilization.
            <br />
            Both Heidegger and Miyazaki remind us that this shift in perspective
            comes at a cost. When we reduce the earth to a resource, we lose our
            connection to its beauty and its deeper meaning. Their work
            encourages us to rethink our relationship with nature, not as
            something to conquer, but as something to care for and coexist with.

            This clip dives deep into Heidegger’s idea of dwelling—living
            meaningfully by being rooted in the world around us. For Heidegger,
            life isn’t just about existing; it’s about being connected to the
            Earth, the Sky, Mortals, and Divinities, the fourfold that shapes
            everything we do. The quote, “we are increasingly surrounded by
            places completely devoid of any meaning,” captures the emptiness of
            modern life, filled with repetitive spaces like malls and office
            buildings that feel disconnected and sterile.
            <br />
            Heidegger believes that we’ve lost something vital in modernity: a
            sense of connection and reverence. We cover the Earth, pollute the
            Sky, deny our mortality, and forget the sacred. By trying to conquer
            everything—turning life into a series of calculations and
            optimizations—we sap it of mystery and meaning. For Heidegger,
            acknowledging our limits, including the fact that we’ll one day die,
            is what gives life its depth. Without this, our actions can feel
            empty.
            <br />
            The clip ties this beautifully to Miyazaki’s films. In Castle in the
            Sky, the disconnect from the Earth and Sky is literal: the floating
            city of Laputa falls apart because it’s lost its connection to the
            natural world. Miyazaki’s work reminds us of the beauty in places
            that feel lived-in and meaningful.
            <br />
            Heidegger’s fourfold offers a guide back to meaningful living. The
            Earth grounds us, providing food, shelter, and a sense of home. The
            Sky brings rhythm and order to our days and seasons. Mortals remind
            us of our finiteness and the importance of cherishing our time. And
            Divinities point to the mystery of life—something beyond our ability
            to control or fully understand.
            <br />
            Through his films, Miyazaki captures this mystery. Influenced by
            Shinto, he shows us worlds where every leaf, stone, and breeze has
            meaning. Heidegger and Miyazaki both remind us that to truly live,
            we need to dwell—not by dominating the world but by caring for it
            and finding wonder in its beauty and complexity.

            This video connects Heidegger’s ideas about divinities with Shinto
            practices, as often depicted in Miyazaki’s films. In Shinto, the
            sacred isn’t something far away or beyond reach—it’s part of
            everyday life and the natural world. A quote from the video sums it
            up well: “The spirits in Shinto are something imminent to the
            everyday.”
            <br />
            In Shinto, sacredness is tied to specific places, like a shrine, a
            tree, or a mountain. The place itself is what makes it special. This
            is different from Christian churches, which are often sacred because
            they symbolize a connection to a higher, spiritual realm. Shinto
            shrines, however, are always closely connected to the natural beauty
            around them. As Sokyo Ono explains, “Shrines cannot be separated
            from the natural beauty that traditionally surrounds them.”
            <br />
            This view of sacredness being rooted in nature matches Heidegger’s
            philosophy. For Heidegger, divinities aren’t about trying to
            understand or control the unknown—they’re about feeling awe and
            reverence for it. As Thomas Sakulis puts it, Shinto encourages
            people to feel “at home with awe,” to embrace the mystery of life
            rather than trying to dominate it.
            <br />
            A simple act like offering rice at a shrine ties into Heidegger’s
            idea of the “fourfold.” The Earth provides the soil for the rice,
            the Sky brings rain and weather, the Mortal (a person) offers the
            rice, and the Divinity blesses the act. This unity reflects
            Heidegger’s idea of “dwelling,” where life has meaning because of
            its connection to the Earth, Sky, Mortals, and Divinities.
            <br />
            Miyazaki’s films bring this philosophy to life. His stories are
            filled with spirits, shrines, and nature, where the sacred is woven
            into everyday life. They remind us to live with care and reverence,
            appreciating the places and beauty around us. Both Heidegger and
            Shinto teach us that life’s meaning comes not from trying to control
            everything but from cherishing the connections and mysteries that
            make life complete.

          <p class="explanation">
            As someone who live in Nasr City, I feel disconnected from nature. I
            would prefer to live in an Egyptian village. This video beautifully
            portrays the essence of a traditional Egyptian village, offering a
            glimpse into a way of life deeply connected to nature. It invites us
            to ponder the profound bond between humans and the natural world—a
            relationship that philosopher Martin Heidegger described as the
            "fourfold" of human existence: earth, sky, divinities, and mortals.
            <br />
            In this peaceful village, life is lived in harmony with these
            elements. The earth is symbolized by the fields and rivers,
            providing both sustenance and beauty. The fertile soil supports a
            simple, agricultural lifestyle, encouraging gratitude and care for
            the land. Unlike urban areas like Nasr City or Fifth Settlement,
            where green spaces are limited and often disconnected, the village
            weaves nature seamlessly into daily life, fostering a deep and
            tangible connection with the earth. <br />
            The sky here feels closer—both literally and figuratively. Modest
            homes, typically one or two stories tall, maintain a sense of
            connection with the open sky. Without skyscrapers obstructing the
            view, the horizon appears infinite, promoting freedom and
            introspection. This starkly contrasts with urban landscapes, where
            towering buildings not only block the sky but also create a sense of
            detachment from nature. <br />
            Divinity is reflected in the tranquil rhythm of village life. Living
            simply amid nature allows space for reflection, prayer, and
            spiritual connection. The slower pace, free from constant
            technological distractions, gives residents time to contemplate
            their place in the universe. Urban life, with its relentless pace
            and overstimulation, often makes such moments of introspection rare.
            <br />
            The people—mortals—are also more connected to each other in the
            village. Narrow streets and smaller homes naturally foster a
            close-knit community, where neighbors interact frequently and
            support one another. This is a sharp contrast to cities, where
            multi-story buildings and isolated living spaces can lead to social
            disconnection. In urban areas, neighbors often live side by side
            without ever truly knowing each other, as city living tends to
            prioritize privacy over community. <br />
            The video also highlights how the village's minimal reliance on cars
            and technology enhances both human and environmental bonds. Fewer
            vehicles mean cleaner air, quieter streets, and safer spaces for
            pedestrians. Children can play outside freely, and neighbors can
            gather without the constant noise of traffic. This kind of lifestyle
            reduces stress and creates a sense of belonging that is increasingly
            rare in urban environments.
            <br />
            Ultimately, this village exemplifies a way of life that harmonizes
            with the "fourfold" of human existence, balancing the natural and
            human-made worlds. It offers a stark contrast to urban life, where
            sprawling developments, tall buildings, and technology often
            distance us from the earth, sky, and each other. Watching this video
            reminds us of the value of simplicity, community, and our intrinsic
            connection to nature. Perhaps it’s time to consider how we can
            incorporate aspects of this village life into modern cities,
            creating environments that honor the fourfold and nurture the human
            spirit.
